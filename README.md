# Portfolio Landing Page

This repository contains my **frontend development portfolio landing page**, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It serves as a central hub to showcase my projects and will be continuously updated as I add new work.

**Live Deployment:** [here](https://portfolio-landing-gamma.vercel.app/)
